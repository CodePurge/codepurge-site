      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the software application **CodePurge** ("Application") developed by **Nikolai Nobadi** ("Developer"). CodePurge is a macOS application designed to help developers manage and clean up Xcode-related files, including derived data, archives, device support files, and simulator storage.</p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>CodePurge does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The Application runs locally on your machine and does not communicate with any external servers except when users choose to check for updates or visit linked resources.</p>

      <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>CodePurge does not collect analytics, track user behavior, or send data to third parties. However, macOS may collect anonymized crash reports if users have opted into Apple's crash reporting system.</p>

      <h3>Use of Data</h3>
      <p>The Application operates entirely on the user's device. Any data processed by CodePurge, such as identifying unnecessary Xcode files, remains on your machine and is not accessible by the Developer.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Because CodePurge does not collect personal data, there is no retention of user information. If you choose to delete Xcode-generated files using the Application, those files are moved to the Trash and can be restored manually if needed.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>Since CodePurge does not transmit data externally, there are no security risks related to personal data exposure. However, users should exercise caution when deleting development files, as some actions may not be reversible.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>CodePurge does not integrate with third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. If users manually visit external links, such as the project's GitHub repository, those services may have their own privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
      <p>Since CodePurge does not collect user data, there is no need for an opt-out process. To stop using the Application, simply delete it from your Mac.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>CodePurge is a developer tool and is not designed for children. The Application does not collect or process information from users under the age of 13.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated as needed. Any changes will be posted here, and continued use of the Application will be considered acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or CodePurge, please contact the Developer at **nnobadicares@gmail.com**.</p>
